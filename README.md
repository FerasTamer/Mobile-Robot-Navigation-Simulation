# Robot Navigation Simulation  

## Description  
This project simulates a robot navigating a grid-based environment using different pathfinding algorithms, including Dijkstra's algorithm, Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A*. The robot is visualized in a Pygame window, allowing users to observe its movement and pathfinding behavior.  

## Features  
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Choose from Dijkstra, BFS, DFS, or A* for pathfinding.  
- **Robot Visualization**: The robot's position and movement are displayed in real time.  
- **User Interaction**: Users can select the algorithm used for navigation via console input.  

## Requirements  
To run this project, you need:  
- Python 3.x  
- Pygame library  

You can install Pygame using pip:  
```bash  
pip install pygame
